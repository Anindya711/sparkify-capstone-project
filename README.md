# sparkify-capstone-project
This is the capstone project of Udacity DSND. As part of this, one churn prediction system is built using pyspark.

**Introduction** \
In this project, we will use PySpark to predict if a customer will cancel the subscription or not for a online music streaming company
called Sparkify. 

**Project Motivation** \
Machine learning is critical to helping different organizations understand which messages are relevant to them and which messages to prioritize. Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. Additionally, the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets with Spark is one of the highest-demand skills in the field of data. The full dataset is 12GB, of which we analyzed a mini subset of 128MB.

**Steps** \
  Load large datasets into Spark and manipulate them using Spark SQL and Spark Dataframes.
  Use the machine learning APIs within Spark ML to build and tune models.
  
**Structure**\
The repository contains following folders.
>*1. data* - contains the mini sparkify dataset.\
>*2. sparkify.ipynb* - Contains the analysis and detailed coding of the project.
>*3. sparkify.html* - Contains the analysis and detailed coding of the project in a html format.
>*4. readme.md* - Readme file.

**Pre-requisites** \
  Following packages should be installed in the system before running the notebook.
  >SparkContext
  >pyspark\
  >pyspark.sql.SparkSession\
  >pyspark.sql\
  >datetime\
  >numpy\
  >pandas\
  >matplotlib.pyplot\
  >sklearn
  >seaborn\
  >pyspark.ml
