# sparkify-capstone-project
This is the capstone project of Udacity DSND. As part of this, one churn prediction system is built using pyspark.

## Introduction
In this project, we will use PySpark to predict if a customer will cancel the subscription or not for a online music streaming company
called Sparkify. 

## Project Motivation
Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. Additionally, the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets with Spark is one of the highest-demand skills in the field of data. The full dataset is 12GB, of which we analyzed a mini subset of 128MB.

## Steps
  Load large datasets into Spark and manipulate them using Spark SQL and Spark Dataframes
  Use the machine learning APIs within Spark ML to build and tune models

## Pre-requisites
